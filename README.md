# web-scraping
This is a repo for the web scraping pipeline related codes. 

The goal is to create user-friendly, widly-applicable programming tools for non-CS/DS background researchers to quickly collect data from online sources. 

Per the team's discussions, there will be two kinds of outcomes: one is python notebook which demonstrate how to use the code and explains how it works with sample data; the other kind of outcome is several .py files which will be packaged into a library for users to import and call.

In terms of naming convention, please use "snake_style" and the A/HC/LC pattern as explained in the following repo:
