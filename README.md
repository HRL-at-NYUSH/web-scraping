# web-scraping

This is a repo for the web scraping pipeline related codes. 

The goal is to create user-friendly, widly-applicable programming tools for non-CS/DS background researchers to quickly collect data from online sources. 

Per the team's discussions, there will be two kinds of outcomes: one is python notebook which demonstrate how to use the code and explains how it works with sample data; the other kind of outcome is several .py files which will be packaged into a library for users to import and call.

For git flow, please refer to the develop/feature/hot-fix strategy described in [this tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

For naming convention, please use "snake_style" and the A/HC/LC pattern as explained in [this repo](https://github.com/kettanaito/naming-cheatsheet).

For function docstrings, please try follow the [Numpy style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html#example-numpy).

For the notification and debugging messages, it is suggested that the message starts with a status code ([Success], [Warning], [Error], etc.)
